/**
 * A Fragile is similar to a {@link Single} but it may throw an {@link Exception} during retrieval of the value.
 * <p>
 * It's primary use case is to allow deferring checked Exceptions if they can't be thrown right away. A common example is Iterating elements, {@link
 * Iterator#next()} doesn't allow checked Exceptions to be thrown. In this case a {@link Fragile} can be returned to defer any exception to evaluation time.
