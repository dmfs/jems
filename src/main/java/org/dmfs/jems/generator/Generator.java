/**
 * A Generator is able to generate an infinite sequence of values. It's similar to {@link Iterator} with the difference that a generator always has a next
 * element, hence there is no {@code hasNext()} method.
 * <p>
 * A Generator also serves as an equivalent to {@link Single} for mutable values. A {@link Single} should not be used with mutable values because mutation of
 * the value would affect all other uses of the {@link Single} because other callers might receive the mutated value. A {@link Generator} on the other hand is
 * expected to return (generate) a new instance on each call if the results are mutable.
